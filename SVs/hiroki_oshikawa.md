title: I listened to more than 70 talks

Hi, I'm Hiroki Oshikawa, junior at The University of Tokyo.
I participated in ICFP 2016 as a student volunteer.
This is a post-conference blog post.

I attended Higher-Order Programming with Effects, the main conference, ML workshop, and OCaml workshop.
I listened to more than 70 talks. 
They included many topics from theoretical subjects to a specific programming language feature. 
To be honest, some of them were so difficult that I couldn't follow at all.
However, every talk let me feel the atmosphere of state-of-the-art programming language researches and related fields.


One of the most impressive talks for me was  _All Sorts of Permutations_ ([preprint](http://informatik.uni-kiel.de/~sad/icfp2016-preprint.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3jqTxJ9Wc)) by Sandra Dylus at the first day of the main conference.
The paper says that any sort function can be converted to a function that enumerates permutations when combined with a non-deterministic predicate.
This is essentially proved by the free theorems, which state general properties of parametric polymorphic functions.

This paper's result is a kind of functional programming technique (in fact, it was accepted as Functional Pearls), but it is guaranteed by abstract theorems. 
I found this interesting because it seemed a good example of feeling the relationship between theory and practice. 


I also enjoyed programming language workshops. It was a lot of fun to listen to talks about new language features or new libraries.
 I was happy to get OCaml stickers and a cute T shirts.


Social activity, such as Student Volunteersâ€™ dinner, was also exiting. I could talk with many students from around the world. 
Since most of them were graduated students, I could ask them about what I am interesting and future careers and their answers were helpful.


Finally, about Student Volunteer jobs. 
I was asked to serve drinks during breaks and help registration desk. They were not so hard. 
Organizers let us be as free as possible and I could listen to all talks in which I was interested. 
So, I recommend students who are interested in ICFP to apply the Student Volunteer!
