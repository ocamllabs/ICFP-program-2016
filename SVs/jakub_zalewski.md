I am a PhD student at [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Pervasive
Parallelism at the University of
Edinburgh](http://pervasiveparallelism.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under
supervision of [Philip Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/),
[Garrett Morris](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jmorri14/), and [Hugh
Leather](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hleather/).  I am currently
working on wide applications of gradual typing in refinement types.
Last month (September 2016) I attended the International Conference on
Functional Programming ([ICFP
2016](http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016)) in Nara, Japan, as
a student volunteer.  I also took part in the student research
competition that was held at the conference.

The conference was an amazing event, as the attendees were able to
enjoy both the wonderful cultural and historical site in Nara and the
recent advances in functional programming languages.

Aside from visiting local temples, I received a lot of insighful and
constructive feedback for my current research during the student
research competition.  Furthermore, I was able to meet the researchers
that are actively advancing the my research area.

One of such highlights was the opportunity to chat with [Rowan
Davies](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/rowan/www/home.html), who
was one of [Frank Pfenning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/)'s students
that worked on the initial work on refinement types.  Rowan explained
to me that the difference between dependent types and refinement types
is similar to the difference between intrinsic typing, also referred
to typing a la Church, and extrinsic typing, also referred to typing
a la Curry.  He also pointed me towards Frank Pfenning's
[work](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/andrews08.pdf) on that
problem.

I greatly enjoyed the opportunity to attent ICFP'16 as a student
volunteer, I learned a lot from the talks and attendees, and I plan to
attend the conference next year.
